			<p>After deciding upon the domain of energy we began thinking of different aspects that would spark interest upon users. Our initial idea was to display the amount of money spent on petroleum mining and distribution over the years yet we found that this information would not inform the users of the various solutions available. So rather we decided to focus on comparing different energy sources in hopes raising awareness of the various ways we can produce energy. In analyzing energy usage we wanted to create a visualization that simply displayed energy consumption between different countries. A clear means of measurement when considering energy consumption was comparing usage between countries. As the numerical measurement gave little to no insight to users we wanted to display this information through percentiles a means that allows for a higher cognitive regard. Thus for our initial visualization we wanted to display the total energy consumption between different countries. In comparing various amounts we found size to be the most advantageous means of expressing differences as it is the first most distinguishable feature in a visualization.</p>
			<p>When considering how to utilize the data through different visualizations we came up with a series of different ways of portraying the data. First we thought of displaying usage over different bar graphs over time. This would allow us to show a clear comparison between different countries and their energy con sumption. Next we thought of using a heat map to differentiate between renewable and nonrenewable energy. The heat map would allow users to quickly see the world and differentiate between different countries while displaying the amount of renewable energy consumption based on colour. In addition to the heat map we wanted to integrate a a star-plot that would display the different energy sources used. This would highlight each countries focus based on a different shape, visualizing where each countrys focus lays in terms of energy production. By glancing at the shape of the star plot the user would be able to differentiate between the countrys means of consumption and would ultimately be able to to see what a sustainable shape encompassed.</p>
